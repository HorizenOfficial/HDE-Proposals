The Horizen Developer Environment - HDE - is a project to foster open-source software development as well as non-code-related contributions to the Horizen blockchain ecosystem.

## What is the HDE?

The [Horizen Developer Environment - HDE](https://hde.horizen.io/) - is a project to foster open-source software development as well as non-code-related contributions to the Horizen blockchain ecosystem.
The goal of the HDE is to amplify the benefits of contributing to open source software and improve the Horizen ecosystem at the same time. 
We want to make it as simple as possible to get started contributing to Horizen, help developers improve their skill set and set a precedent for community-driven open source software projects on how to leverage the growing community of open source developers.
